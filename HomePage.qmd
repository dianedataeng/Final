# Emergency Room Utilization: In Patient Admissions, Costs, and Insurance Impacts

Welcome to the project website for the STAT 515 Final Project. This site summarizes the full analysis of emergency room (ER) utilization using the 2023 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) dataset.

## Project Overview
This project investigates emergency room visits in the United States and examines:

- **Predictors of inpatient admission** after an ER visit.
- **Which ER characteristics lead to the highest total expenditures.**
- **Whether insurance status impacts the number of tests or procedures a patient receives**, and how socioeconomic factors contribute.

The dataset includes **4,241 ER visits** with information about:
- Diagnostic tests (MRI/CT, X-ray, ultrasound, etc.)
- Procedures (surgery, prescriptions)
- Costs (facility, doctor, insurance payments, out-of-pocket)
- Insurance coverage
- Demographics (sex, poverty category)

This site contains the full project analysis, tables, models, visualizations, and interpretations.
