# STAT 515: Emergency Room Utilization – Diane Kim

This graduate-level project analyzes **emergency room (ER) visits** using data from the **2023 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)**.  
The goal is to understand factors influencing inpatient admissions, ER costs, and the number of diagnostic tests and procedures.

---

## Research Questions

1. Which factors predict inpatient admission?  
2. What drives the highest ER expenditures?  
3. What influences the number of tests and procedures per visit?

## Data & Methods

- **Data:** 4,241 ER visits from MEPS 2023, merged with demographic and socioeconomic info  
- **53 Variables:** Admission status, total cost, insurance, sex, poverty category, and diagnostic procedures  
- **Outputs:** Visualizations, statistical models, and a 10-minute oral presentation
- **Analysis Methods:**  
  - **Logistic Regression**   
  - **Multiple Linear Regression** 
  - **Poisson Regression** 
  - **Random Forest**
    
- Interactive and static **visualizations** to explore ER patterns  
- Statistical models highlighting **key predictors** for each research question
- **Performance Evaluation:** Each model’s performance assessed using **accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity** (for classification) and **RMSE / R²** (for regression).
